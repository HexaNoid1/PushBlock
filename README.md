PushBlock is an informative website that aims to get those interested in learning how to play fighting games on the right path towards doing so.</br> <br>
Due to the wide variety of games in this genre and the differences between them, PushBlock will give users basic fundamental knowledge required to understand what a fighting game is, how they are played and link to relevant third-party resources for specific games in order to gain more depth on the user's perferred game. <br> <br>
The home page will consist of a landing page introduces users to the concept of fighting games while encouraging them to Learn More/Get Started by clicking a button that will link them to a more detailed explaination of the genre. Furthermore, I will include a Games page which will have clickable logos for a select amount of popular fighting games that lead to other resources that will enable a user to further their learning.
